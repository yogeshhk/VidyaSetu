# VidyaSetu (विद्या - सेतू )  Faculty Path

Repository for a bridge to transition career from professionals to professors.  

T3Tech: \[Train-The-Trainer\] Technologies, B2S2T: Back2School2Teach

## **Introduction**

In my two decades of teaching across various colleges as a visiting, co-teaching, and adjunct faculty member, I've observed a concerning trend: student interest in learning is progressively deteriorating. While it might sound harsh, I don't blame students entirely. The effectiveness of teaching plays a crucial role in engaging learners. We all know that you naturally develop a love for a subject when the teacher is exceptional.

To uplift the quality of Indian education, we must focus not just on improving student learning, but also on enhancing teaching effectiveness. I don't fully blame teachers either. They face numerous non-teaching pressures and often struggle to stay updated with the latest global innovations and practices.

One effective solution emerges: integrating professionals directly into the educational ecosystem. This transition can range from one-hour expert lectures to full-time Professor of Practice roles. Having personally navigated this path, I've witnessed remarkable outcomes of professional-to-academia transitions.

Our target audience isn't limited to industry professionals eager to share expertise. We also aim to engage:

* Industry Professionals (mid-career)  
* Qualified homemakers  
* Early retirees  
* Unemployed individuals  
* UPSC/MPSC aspirants  
* Retired professionals with time, interest, and domain expertise

The primary gap? Most lack exposure to modern teaching methodologies, pedagogical techniques, and educational tools.

Our mission is clear:

* Bridge the knowledge gap  
* Make interested professionals teaching-ready  
* Create a comprehensive playbook for seamless career transition
