# Survey of Institutes: Demand Side

Covers personas who want professionals to come and teach ie Demand side. They are current students at colleges, current colleges (profs, VC/directors)

Persona - understand your stakeholders - current students at colleges, current colleges (profs, VC/directors), current experts (professional experts, retiree experts, homemaker experts, et al. I'll shy away from saying unemployed experts, since I'm afraid they may not be experts.. maybe you wanted to say self employed), and current FDP resource providers and connectors/facilitators between colleges and experts. Come up with insights, tell me 3 things that we didn't know before. To get insights, dive into the following -
What are their needs vs wants
What is their biggest pain point
What is their mental model (let me know if you need help on this)
What is a typical journey map (including emotions) in what they go through, there may be multiple journeys you may document.
