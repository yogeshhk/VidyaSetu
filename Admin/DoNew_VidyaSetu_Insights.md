## From Institutes, Faculties (Demand Side)

### **Challenges for Professionals Transitioning to Teaching**  
1. **Underestimating the Workload**:  
   - Teaching requires meticulous preparation of materials, including detailed explanations and exercises.  
   - Be ready to address a wide range of student queries, from basic to advanced.  
   - Administrative tasks, like grading and reporting, demand additional time and effort.  
   - **Suggestion**: Start with guest lectures to experience the teaching dynamic and gradually transition to regular roles.  

2. **Difference Between Team Talks and Classroom Teaching**:  
   - Corporate presentations are typically goal-oriented and concise, whereas classroom teaching demands in-depth explanations and interactive methods.  
   - **Suggestion**: Practice engaging teaching techniques like storytelling, case studies, and visual aids to bridge the gap.  
### **Challenges with Commitment and Engagement**  
1. **Competing Engagements**:  
   - Skilled (specially those who are very good) professionals often juggle multiple responsibilities, making it hard to dedicate sufficient time to teaching.  
   - **Suggestion**: Institutes should offer flexible compensation models like per-hour or per-course payments instead of rigid monthly salaries.  

2. **Motivational Issues**:  
   - Some professionals join teaching roles for reasons other than genuine interest, affecting their contribution quality.  
   - **Suggestion**: Screen candidates through trial lectures or mock sessions to ensure alignment with academic values.     

## From Professionals  (Supply Side)

### **Institutes' Role in Supporting Professionals**  
1. **Gratitude and Flexibility**:  
   - Institutes must appreciate the unique contributions of professionals and provide time flexibility.  
   - Strict adherence to rigid rules, timings, or methodologies may deter professionals.  
   - **Suggestion**: Offer hybrid roles or part-time opportunities with minimal administrative burdens to encourage participation.  

2. **Tailored Policies for Professionals**:  
   - Recognize their existing commitments and create custom engagements that respect their time constraints.  
   - **Suggestion**: Provide online teaching options, project-based mentoring, or short-term courses.  

### **Incentives for Attracting Talented Professionals**  
1. **Professor of Practice Roles**:  
   - The full-time presence requirement and limited compensation (e.g., â‚¹1L per month) make these roles unattractive.  
   - **Suggestion**:  
     - Reframe these roles as flexible adjunct positions with proportional compensation.  
     - Introduce industry-linked benefits, such as research funding or consulting opportunities.  

2. **Highlighting Value Propositions**:  
   - Emphasize the fulfillment of shaping young minds and the intellectual stimulation that teaching offers.  
   - **Suggestion**: Create testimonials or case studies of successful corporate-to-academia transitions to inspire others.
