## Brainstorming

Following prompt has been used to generate project ideas

| You are an expert Career Coach. Following is an assessment of a psychometric test. Analyze the results carefully. Think step by step and suggest a very challenging project that combines the function and the role. It should also take into consideration preferences mentioned. The suggested Project has to be following ikigai principles and the concept of "specific knowledge" by  naval ravikant. It should be at the moonshot level but to be finished in 2-3 months. We should be addressing real pain points on the ground via this moonshot project. \#\# Test results \- Strength:     \- Major: Articulate, Humility, Evangelist, Objective, Communicator,    \- Minor: Street Smart, Get it done, Multi Tasker, Organizer, Quantifier \- Non-Strengths: Route Planner, Zoom in-out \- Soft Skills: Upward Communication, Leadership for project/team, Multiple  team/project  management \- Non Soft Skills: Quality, Strategic direction \- Top Functions:   \- Product Sales (?) / Consulting Track   \- Program Management   \- Technical Writer \- Top Domains:    \- Education    \- Society and culture    \- Health \#\# Preferences Less preferred:   \- Function: "society and culture" and "Health" as functions as I am not qualified.  \- Role: "program management" and "Technical writer" as role.

Refined the prompt to include the following as this has been my own journey (Teach in Part II)

| Lets dig deeper into the first idea i.e. the "Ed-Tech Pathway Navigator" Project.  Can it be tailored to make it more specific, more niche as its USP based on the following points  \- Looking to do something especially for mid-career folks, their mid-career transitions as they can pay as well, formal certification, providing a learning path, etc.  \- Rational: I feel the biggest education quality drop is not due to students but the faculty is not qualified and motivated to instill good education in students So faculty assessment, coaching, assessment, evaluation certification across board is a must.  \- Edtech training and certification platform for faculty also for those who wish to transition mid career from corporates to teaching plus senior citizens.  |
