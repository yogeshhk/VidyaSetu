# Research 'World Out There'

The transition from professional practice to academia presents unique challenges for new faculty members. Research indicates that practitioners-turned-professors face struggles with their new role, self-identity, and academic culture (Kinsey et al., 2006). To facilitate this transition, mentoring programs are crucial, leading to greater job satisfaction, teaching competence, and research productivity (Thomsen & Gustafson, 1997). A blueprint for successful transition includes components such as understanding academic culture, developing teaching skills, and balancing research expectations (Wanat & Garey, 2013). Institutions should provide support through faculty development programs and mentoring relationships to address the specific needs of these transitioning professionals (Crane et al., 2009). Despite the value of their practical experience, especially in applied fields, new faculty members may face unanticipated challenges that require targeted support from colleagues and administrators (Crane et al., 2009; Thomsen & Gustafson, 1997).

## From Notebook LM

### Introduction:

This document summarizes key insights from three sources regarding the transition from professional practice to academia, focusing on the experiences of those moving into faculty positions, particularly in education-related fields. The sources highlight the challenges, opportunities, and support systems necessary for a successful transition. These articles provide both a personal and research-based look at the transition experience. The central theme is the importance of community, support, and a realistic understanding of the academic landscape for those making the shift from practitioner to professor.

### I. Main Themes and Key Ideas

- A Growing Trend: The transition from professional practice to academia is an increasingly common second career move (Bauer, 2020; Coleman et al., 2006; LaRocco & Bruns, 2006). This trend is fueled by the need for experienced professionals to fill faculty positions, often due to retirements and expanding academic expectations (LaRocco & Bruns, 2006).
- Unique Strengths of Practitioners: Professionals entering academia bring valuable practical experience, real-world knowledge, and a practitioner's perspective to teaching and research (Bauer, 2020; LaRocco & Bruns, 2006). As one participant in the LaRocco & Bruns study stated "Students value [my experience] immensely, I think it gives me amazing credibility with them; they really seem to want to hear about the knowledge that I’ve gained from the classroom from the field without reservation, without questioning”
- The Triad of Academic Responsibilities: New faculty must navigate the three pillars of academia: teaching, research, and service/citizenship (Bauer, 2020; Coleman et al., 2006; LaRocco & Bruns, 2006). Mastering these areas requires a different skillset and mindset than professional practice (Coleman et al., 2006)
- Significant Challenges in Transition: The transition is not seamless. It often involves a "struggle with the role" (understanding and fulfilling the demands of a faculty position), a "struggle with self" (adjusting professional identity and status), "cultural struggle" (navigating the norms and expectations of the university), and "future struggles" (concerns about career progression) (Coleman et al., 2006).
- Importance of Community and Support: Strong social networks, mentoring, and collegial relationships are vital for the well-being and success of new faculty (Bauer, 2020; Coleman et al., 2006; LaRocco & Bruns, 2006). Without these, new faculty can experience feelings of isolation, alienation, and disenfranchisement (Coleman et al., 2006).
- Need for Mentorship: Mentoring by experienced faculty is crucial for new professors to learn the ropes, seek pedagogical guidance, navigate university systems, and get support on issues ranging from course structure to difficult student issues. (Bauer, 2020; Coleman et al., 2006). Mentors provide tested course models, advice on student evaluations, and guidance on research and publication (Bauer, 2020).
- Cultural Differences & Navigating the Academic Culture: New faculty often find the academic culture to be significantly different from their previous workplaces, often marked by less collaboration, more autonomy, and a slower pace (Bauer, 2020; Coleman et al., 2006; LaRocco & Bruns, 2006). They may have to learn a "hidden curriculum" of norms and expectations that are not explicitly stated (Coleman et al., 2006).
- Shifting Identities: Transitioning from a leadership role to a new faculty position can cause a major shift in professional self-identity, as practitioners might go from being the "top of an organization" to a feeling of being at the "bottom" in the academic hierarchy (Coleman et al., 2006).
The Demands of Scholarship: Academic writing and publishing pose significant challenges, particularly for those with experience in applied, rather than theoretical fields. It's necessary to understand the nuances of publishing in peer-reviewed journals for tenure and promotion (Coleman et al., 2006).
- Time Management and Stress: Balancing teaching, research, and service can be overwhelming, leading to job-related stress and potential work-life imbalance (LaRocco & Bruns, 2006). As one respondent in the LaRocco & Bruns study put it "Doing literally 13-hour days..."

### II. Specific Insights from Each Source

- "The power of community in the business professional to academic transition" (Bauer, 2020):This article is a personal reflection emphasizing the power of community in navigating the transition.
	- It identifies four key communities: departmental faculty mentors, the broader university community, the student body, and non-profit organizations.
	- Key Quote: "To the extent that I have been able to be successful on the job, I feel it is mainly due to the sense of community I have built with other individuals at the university."
	- Highlights the importance of seeking mentors, proactively building relationships with colleagues, administrators, and students.
	- Suggests practical actions such as utilizing faculty models for course design, offering career advice to students, and engaging in service to non-profits to integrate with the academic environment.
- "Transition from Practitioner to Professor: The Struggle of New Faculty to find their Place in the World of Academia" (Coleman et al., 2006):This piece focuses on the experiences of former K-12 school administrators transitioning to the professoriate.
	- Identifies four primary struggles: with role, self, culture, and future.
	- Key Quote: “The world of research and academic writing remains unsullied in their minds as they accept their new mortarboard as a junior professor. This is not, however, the typical experience for those who complete their graduate degrees while serving in K-12 school administration.”
	- Highlights the challenges related to scholarly writing, service requirements, the need to adjust to a non-hierarchical professional environment, and the shift in professional identity.
	- Stresses that the transition represents a mid-life career change, which requires significant personal and professional adjustments.
	- Advocates for mentoring of new faculty, especially in the areas of publishing and navigating university policies and norms.
- "Practitioner to professor: Second career academics' perceptions of entry into the academy" (LaRocco & Bruns, 2006):This is a research study based on interviews with eight pre-tenure, second-career academics.
	- The study shows that practitioners feel generally prepared for teaching and research, but not for "institutional citizenship."
	- Key Quote: "I don’t know that I had any specific preparation in serving on committees and that sort of thing. I think if my professors did that when I was in the doctoral program, I think I was kind of unaware of all that; and so, that was new for me."
	- Highlights the value that participants placed on their practical experience, noting that they feel it enhances their teaching credibility and ability to connect theory and practice.
	- Demonstrates that the participants, accustomed to a collaborative environment in professional practice, find academic settings to be more isolating and less collaborative.
	- Calls for doctoral programs to expand training to include all aspects of faculty life, not just teaching and research, and to better prepare students for the full range of academic roles and responsibilities.
 ### III. Recommendations and Implications

- For Universities:Implement robust mentoring programs that pair new faculty with experienced mentors (Bauer, 2020; Coleman et al., 2006; LaRocco & Bruns, 2006).

- For Doctoral Programs:Expand curricula to include comprehensive training in all aspects of faculty life, including institutional citizenship, networking, and the realities of academic life (LaRocco & Bruns, 2006).
	- Offer practicum experiences that allow students to gain experience in teaching, research, and service (LaRocco & Bruns, 2006).
	- Clearly delineate career paths available with a doctorate, helping students identify careers that align with their values, skills, and interests (LaRocco & Bruns, 2006).
- For Transitioning Practitioners:Actively seek mentors and build strong professional networks.
	- Be proactive in seeking assistance and support, as academic environments are not always as collaborative as previous workplaces (Bauer, 2020).
	- Recognize that a shift in identity is part of the transition and manage expectations accordingly.
	- Understand the significant differences between the academic world and professional practice, and adapt your work approach to the academic culture.
	- Emphasize the value of their practical experience in teaching and research, leveraging it to connect theory to practice (LaRocco & Bruns, 2006). Conclusion

The transition from practitioner to professor is a significant journey that requires preparation, support, and resilience. These sources emphasize the need for institutional awareness, robust mentoring, and a realistic understanding of the academic landscape. By addressing the unique challenges and leveraging the strengths of transitioning professionals, universities can create a more supportive and enriching environment for these valuable members of the academic community.
