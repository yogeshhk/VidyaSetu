# Transition from Corporate to Academic Teaching Career: Playbook for Stakeholders

## Introduction

The shift from a corporate or industry-focused career to an academic teaching career can be a significant transition for many professionals. While this transition offers new opportunities for personal growth and the chance to share valuable industry insights with students, it also comes with its own set of challenges. Professionals who are making this shift are expected to align their real-world experience with the academic standards and expectations of colleges and students. At the same time, academic institutions must adapt to integrate these professionals and create a conducive environment for their unique skill sets.

This playbook aims to provide a comprehensive, actionable guide to all the stakeholders involved in this transition. The playbook outlines expectations, challenges, and actionable strategies for the following key roles:

1. **Current Students at Colleges**  
2. **Current Colleges (Professors, Vice Chancellors, Directors)**  
3. **Current Professionals/Experts (Professional Experts, Retirees, Homemakers, etc.)**  
4. **Current FDP Resource Providers and Facilitators (Who Bridge the Gap Between Colleges and Experts)**  

Each role has unique needs and perspectives, and understanding these expectations can foster a successful and meaningful transition from corporate to academic life.
