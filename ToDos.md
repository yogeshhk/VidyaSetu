## **Next Steps**
* The first step to tackle any moonshot is to understand the problem from the persona's point of view and from the world's points of view - both qualitatively and quantitatively.  
   - Come up with 2-3 insights that were not known before and 2-3 things out there in the world that already exist, 
   - Put this into a mindmap. Use Google Drawings, Coggle, Miro, Obsidian, et al.
	- *Persona* - understand the stakeholders 
		- current students at colleges, 
		- current colleges (profs, VC/directors), 
		- current experts (professional experts, retiree experts, homemaker experts, et al. 
		- current FDP resource providers and connectors/facilitators between colleges and experts. 
	- Come up with insights, tell 3 things that weren't know before. To get insights, dive into the following -
		- What are their needs vs wants
		- What is their biggest pain point
		- What is their mental model 
		- What is a typical journey map (including emotions) in what they go through, there may be multiple journeys.
	- *The world out there* - 
		- know what people have done to tackle these painpoints 
		- validate what the personas are saying with data. 
		- dig into 
			- Research papers in journals, conferences, documented case studies, 
			- In depth analysis articles, 
			- Data from colleges (e.g. NIRF submissions, revenue breakdown, etc)
			- Constructs in another domain but for similar problems

* DoNew project updates (daily or weekly - more frequent the fast the feedback cycles) in the following format -
	- What did you accomplish that week?
	- What do you plan to do the next week?
	- What did you learn that was new and exciting?
	- What was blocking you and how did you try to overcome it (even though you may be still blocked)?
* Start Saturday office hours for this transition 
* Once finalized review beta test then publish post, use QR code pic for the Google form and use that pic in LinkedIn post instead of web-link.
* Ask people to collaborate, put issues, send PRs
* Make comprehensive learning path diagram, many sub markdown files , images folder etc, all playbooks are made public 
* For chatbot: Create json graph for learning path, role, domain, topic, build graph LLM rag on top, streamlit UI 
* Do certifications yourself 
* Refine the MVP requirements and prioritize core features.  
* Develop partnerships with education boards for certification validation.  
* Identify pilot institutions or user groups for testing.  
* Launch with a focused marketing campaign targeting mid-career professionals and senior citizens.
